            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi everyone! I am a junior of the KSU Informationn Technology program with the enterprise concentration track. I was originally a Computer Science major but I found that I 
                enjoy to work more hands on with computers and networks, hence the switched up. I do also like programming and coding, so I am looking forward to this class. As you can tell, I am a believer 
                that dark mode is superior. I am hoping to reach into areas that I have not explored before and dive a little deeper than I would have thought to do outside of this class. Thanks for reading, I hope everyone has a great semester.
            </p>

            <h3>About This Website</h3>
            <p>This website is used to host all of my work and milestones from the IT4403 Advanced Web and Mobile App development class taught by Professor Prettyman.
                The website will evolve over time as I add more content and learn more advanced techniques of web dev. I am using <a href="https://github.com/ejohn4244/IT4403">Github</a> to host the website as I used Azure in the past and 
                I want to expand my skills into multiple platforms. 
            </p>
